Description: Takes the data from a standard status table, 
    which has a row for each patient screened and each 
    participant enrolled, and columns for each change in status,
    and uses this table to build a CONSORT diagram in ggplot. 
    CONSORT diagrams improve the transparency of reporting of
    randomized, controlled clinical trials.
