The goal of {ggconsort} is to make it easy to create CONSORT diagrams for the transparent reporting of participant allocation in randomized, controlled clinical trials. This is done by creating a standardized status table, and using this table as the source for the creation of a custom ggplot that creates a standard CONSORT diagram.
